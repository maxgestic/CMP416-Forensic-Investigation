# Brief
You are working with a national security agency on an international sporting  
competition corruption case. You have been asked to perform an investigation of the  
following network captures the agency has exfiltrated from parties of interest. You  
must recover the requested information for each capture.

# Capture 1.pcap ([[PCAP1]])
Our intelligence has warned us of suspected bribery in an international competition.  
Our suspect has downloaded files, and we have been tipped that the files may contain  
a list of potential names/aliases of actors in this corruption case that is paramount  
for our investigation. We need to know the details of the usernames, how they were  
hidden, and how you were able to recover them. Details of any other files or noise in  
the capture are of no interest to us and need not be reported in any significant detail.  

# Capture 2.pcap ([[PCAP2]])
We have picked up FTP and other traffic between a suspected corrupt official and a  
foreign national. Decode this traffic and provide us with evidence of what item the  
corrupt official received. We suspect that some anti-forensic practices have been  
used to hide information sent—we have been tipped that an Edward Snowden quote  
may help you decipher.  

# Capture 3.pcap ([[PCAP3]])
We have uncovered communication traffic between Ill-Song and a known person of  
interest taking part in the international competition—Ann Dercover. We believe that  
they are trying to set up a meeting discreetly to avoid detection. We need to know  
the details of the conversation and the date and time they are planning to meet.
